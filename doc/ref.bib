	abstract = {Papillary thyroid cancer ({PTC}) is one of the endocrine cancers with high clinical and genetic heterogeneity. {NOTCH} signaling and its downstream {NOTCH}-Regulated Ankyrin Repeat Protein ({NRARP}) have been implicated in oncogenesis of many cancers, but the roles in {PTCs} are less studied. In this study, we show that {NRARP} is frequently over-expressed in thyroid carcinoma. The over-activation of {NRARP} is highly and positively correlated with {NOTCH} genes. Moreover, we find that the expression of {NRARP} is highly associated with several epithelial mesenchymal transition ({EMT}) markers and contributes to poor survival outcomes. Therefore, these results indicate that {NRARP} is an important clinical biomarker in thyroid carcinoma and it promotes {EMT} induction as well as the progression of {PTCs} via {NOTCH} signaling activation.},
